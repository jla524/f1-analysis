# F1 Analysis
Analyzing Formula 1 race data using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, and SQL magic for IPython.


## Overview
Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the 
Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One 
World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugaural 
season in 1950.

The dataset contains data from 1950 all the way through the 2017 season, and consists of tables describing 
constructors, race drivers, lap times, pit stops and more.

F1 analysis can be run from an iteractive Python notebook. I recommend installing the 
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
and using Jupyter Notebook. To start Jupyter, use the command `jupyter-notebook`.


## Installing Python Libraries

1.  Install with [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

    `pip install -U pandas matplotlib ipython-sql`
    
2.  Install with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

    `conda install -c conda-forge pandas matplotlib ipython-sql`
